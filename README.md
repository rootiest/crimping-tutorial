## Step 1: Cut the Wire

Cut the end of the wire to remove any old connectors
and have a clean end for stripping.  
If your wire is already cut to the length you need then
this step may be skipped.

![Cut Wire](resources/cut-wire.jpg)

---

## Step 2: Strip the Wire

Strip about 2-3mm of insulation from the end of your wire.  
This should be just enough to fit in the connector terminal so the strands
reach the far end and the insulation jacket will reach inside the wings of
the terminal connector.

Use the stripping tool you feel most comfortable with.  
Ensure the wire gauge is compatible with the tool.

## Step 3: Insert Terminal into Crimps

Insert the terminal connector into the crimp tool.  
Use the correct teeth for your terminal connector size.  
Ensure the terminal is aligned and oriented correctly on the die.  
Ensure the end of the connector will not be crimped but the wings
of the connector will be.
The wings should face up and the terminal sits on top of the bottom teeth.  
It should **_NOT_** go in the valley between the bottom teeth.  
When we crimp, the wings will be pressed into
the valley between the **_TOP_** teeth.

## Step 4: (Optional) Squeeze Crimps to First Click

For many connector types you can now squeeze the crimps until the first click.  
This allows the crimps to hold the connector terminal in place while you
insert the wire (See next step)  
Once again, ensure the connector stays aligned and properly oriented.

## Step 5: Insert Wire into Terminal

Insert the stripped wire into the JST-PH terminal.  
Ensure all the wire strands are inside the crimp area.  
Ensure the insulation will be crimped by the wings.
Crimping the insulation makes the terminal hold the wire tightly.  
If your stripped end is too long, cut some off
with your wire cutters before crimping.

Some users may prefer to insert the wire into the terminal
before placing in the crimp tool.  
Personally, I prefer to align the terminal in the tool
before inserting the wire.

## Step 6: Crimp the Terminal

Squeeze the handles until the tool releases.  
The terminal should now be securely crimped to the wire.  
Do not squeeze **_TOO_** hard and do not squeeze too little.  
The handle ratchet should release when you have squeezed enough.

Squeezing too hard may damage the connector or the wire.  
Squeexing too little may not crimp the connector securely.

## Step 7: Verify Crimp Success

Check that the wire is securely crimped.  
Ensure the connector pin end has not been damaged.  
The insulation should be crimped under the wings.

See the [Bad Crimps](#bad-crimps) section for examples of bad crimp jobs.

This is a successful, secure crimp:

## Step 8: Insert Terminal into Connector Housing

Insert the crimped terminal into the JST-PH connector housing
until it clicks into place.  
Ensure it is inserted in the correct orientation.

See the [Wrong Orientation](#wrong-orientation-in-housing) section
for the incorrect orientation.

This is the correct orientation for a JST-PH connector:

---

## Step 9: Finished Assembly

Check your work.  
The terminal should be secure and the wire should not pull out easily.  
Note that the little notch/tail locks securely onto the plastic.

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!

You have successfully crimped a JST-PH connector
using the IWISS 3220M crimp tool.

## Troubleshooting

The following are examples of common mistakes made when crimping.

### Bad Crimps

The following are poorly crimped connectors:

- This terminal connector end was damaged because it was
  inserted too far into the crimp tool.  
  The connector will fail because it won't make a good connection
  and may slip out of the housing.
  ![Damaged Connector](resources/damaged-connector.jpg)

- This terminal connector was not laying flat on the teeth
  when it was crimped.  
  The crimp was made with the connector sitting at an angle.  
  The connector will likely not fit inside the housing
  and won't securely hold the wire.
  ![Wrong Angle Crimp](resources/crimped-wrong-angle.jpg)

### Wrong Orientation in Housing

The terminal connector should be "upside-down" when inserted
into the housing.  
The little notch/tail will latch onto the plastic housing,
holding it securely in place.  
This is the incorrect orientation.  
The connector will not be held securely in the housing or may not
fit in the housing at this orientation.
